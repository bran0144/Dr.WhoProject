    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Technology that I used in this project: Python, Flask, Jinja, Javascript, AJAX, jQuery, HTML, Bootstrap,
        CSS, JSON, and PostgreSQL.</p>
    <p>API's used in project: Google Maps for Javascript API, and created an API using JSON for episode info in 
        Google Maps using an AJAX call.</p> 
    <p>Data: Collected address and lat/long data from moviemaps.org, cleaned that data and assigned episode foreign keys.
        Created episode info table including info on actors and IMDB links.</p>
    <p>I started this site as a project for Hackbright, a full-stack coding 
    bootcamp. As someone who loves Doctor Who, I thought it would be fun to have a 
    searchable database for places where Doctor Who has been filmed. The data was more difficult to find than I expected.
    IMDB does not have an API, and the data would have been difficult to compile that data in a timely manner, 
    even with a webscraping tool like Beautiful Soup. Luckily, I contacted moviemaps.org who was willing to 
    share their data on filming locations including the lat/long. I compiled an episode database on my own that 
    included information on season, episode title, which iteration of the Doctor, which companion and guest star, 
    and a link to the IMDB page about that episode.</p>

    <p>After gathering and cleaning the data, I built a one to many data model as it would be the 
    simplest way to search the data. While there were some locations that appear in multiple 
    episodes, it was less than 5% of the data, so I determined to simplify it in light of
    the time constraints of the project. In the future, I would like to build a many to many
    table that would include those data points, as well as the few episodes that include multiple
    doctors and companions.</p>

    <p>For the UI, I decided to have the user start at a homepage with multiple search
    options so that the map could display multiple pins, say, all the locations where the 10th Doctor,
    David Tennant, filmed. There is also an option for users to look at an episode list that includes
    links to IMDB as well as links to the map for that specific episode. Once a user enters their search
    parameters, a map, typically with mulitple pins, will display. When a user hovers over a pin, an
    Information Box will display that includes episode information. When a user clicks on a pin, it takes
    the user to a map that displays a zoomed in version of that single pin along with episode information.</p>

    <p>One challenge I had was using the Google Maps API. It was more complicated that I expected, but 
    then was very versatile once I got the hang of it. Another challenge was creating an API for Google Maps to search 
    my database through an AJAX call in order to display the episode information in an information box. While
    this was complicated, particularly dealing with asynchronous loading, the final product has turned 
    out better than I expected.</p>

    <p>When deciding on the layout and design, I wanted to emulate the iconic Tardis blue and white throughout the site. 
    I also wanted to simulate the Tardis windows with the search dropdown boxes on the homepage and the "Police Box" 
    above the navbar. On each side of the search dropdowns is the Gallifreyan language (the circular written 
    language from the home planet of the Doctor). I designed my own logo "Doctor Who What Where" for the site using 
    Paint S for Mac. I also found and resized a tardis png for the markers in Google Maps to continue the theming
    onto the maps. </p>
