#Doctor Who What Where

## Introduction:

As a fan of both travel and Doctor Who, I wanted to create a tool that organized and allowed the user to search for their favorite film sites from the popular show.

### Features:

- Allow user to search by season and episode, by title, or by Doctor (i.e. David Tennant)
- Displays multiple sites on a map that includes an information box with information about the episode it was filmed
- Allow user to click to page with a single site and additional information including a link to IMDB page about episode
- Includes a full episode list with links to relavant map and IMDB page

### Landing Page

### Video Demo:

#### Languages:

- Python
- Javascript/jQuery
- CSS
- HTML
- PostgresSQL

** Framework/libraries: **
- Flask
- Bootstrap

** APIs: **
- Google Maps Javascript API 

#### Future State

- I hope to extend the project to include a user login to allow the user to save their favorite sites and create printable maps

#### Running Locally:

In terminal, run "python3 server.py" from root directory
