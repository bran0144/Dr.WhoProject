#Doctor Who What Where

## Introduction:

As a fan of both travel and Doctor Who, I wanted to create a tool that organized and allowed the user to search for their favorite film sites from the popular show.

### Features:

- Allow user to search by season and episode, by title, or by Doctor (i.e. David Tennant)
- Displays multiple sites on a map that includes an information box that pops up on mouseover with information about the episode it was filmed
- Allow user to click from pin on map page to page with a single site and additional information including a link to IMDB page about episode
- Includes a full episode list with links to relavant map and IMDB page
- Includes an additional page with the most iconic sites from Doctor Who, links to youtube videos showing the relevant scenes from Doctor Who at the site, and links to information about visiting that site


### Landing Page

### Video Demo:

#### Languages:

- Python
- Javascript/jQuery
- CSS
- HTML
- PostgresSQL

** Framework/libraries: **
- Flask
- Bootstrap

** APIs: **
- Google Maps Javascript API
- Created an API of episode info for Google Maps to call using AJAX 

#### Future State

- I hope to extend the project to include a user login to allow the user to save their favorite sites and create printable maps
- I would like to expand the database to include a many-to-many relationship for the few sites that appear in multiple episodes and for the few episodes that include multiple Doctors

#### Running Locally:

In terminal, run "python3 server.py" from root directory
